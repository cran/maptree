Changes in contributed package maptree:

1.3-3, 6 March 2003

* removed call to tree.depth in draw.tree (now causing failure)

1.3-2, 22 April 2002

* draw.tree now labels factor splits correctly for rpart objects
  (but not for tree objects) and has an argument print.levels,
  default TRUE, to avoid printing levels when there are too many

* kgs has new argument alpha that weights contribution of number 
  of clusters to penalty function

* draw.tree argument digits defaults to getOption("digits")

1.3-1, 8 April 2002

* new function kgs computes penalty measure for cluster trees.

* draw.clust, draw.tree, and map.groups now have argument new (default
  TRUE) to accomodate multiple figure plots (when new=FALSE).

* map.groups now maps group identifiers to dense integers for 
  referencing color numbers.

* prune.clust now returns correct components on pruned clusters, 
  plus new component "size" having number of observations included 
  in each pruned leaf.

* draw.clust has new argument nodeinfo, which if TRUE causes the 
  number of observations included in each leaf to be displayed 
  (for pruned clusters).

* map.key argument "lables" changed in spelling to "labels".

1.2-1, 15 March 2002

* draw.clust, draw.tree, map.key, and map.groups now use cex for 
  sizing text and symbols.

* prune.Rpart uses best argument as advertised.  Thanks to Brian 
  Ripley for identification of problem and suggestion of solution.

* draw.tree now correctly displays response level for classification 
  trees.
